There is a Docker file, but Selenium + app mode for whatever reason doesn't like 
running inside Docker, so to set up the environment, you should just do what the
Dockerfile says on a new server, just manually.

The three main file/directory dependencies are:
  - 'chromedriver' binary
  - 'google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb'
  - 'selenium' directory.

  The chromedriver is required for Selenium to run and was downloaded from
  <https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=85.0.4183.87/>.

  The deb file is used to install Google Chrome, as the Dockerfile instructs.
  It is downloaded from the official Google Chrome download location.

  The 'selenium' directory is where the session information is stored so that
  we do not have to log in every single time, and in fact, *all* browser session
  information is stored.

Selenium does not run in headless mode; it instead runs on Xvfb frame buffer, 
managed by the systemd script 'vncd.service'. You should install and start the
service before the script is run; the frame buffer runs as DISPLAY=:1.

When you run 'ps aux | grep X', it should have a line like:
    /usr/bin/Xtigervnc :1 -desktop insta-screenshot-service:1 (root) -auth /root/.Xauthority -geometry 1920x1080 -depth 24 -rfbwait 30000 -rfbauth /root/.vnc/passwd -rfbport 5900 -pn -SecurityTypes TLSVnc
